# Laundry Tracker

Work in progress

Want to save people's time in dragging their laundry all the way to the laundry room just for all the machines to be full, and then they have to go all the way back to their room and wait, possibly for the process to happen again.

The goal of this app is for residents to contribute to the app when they do laundry, because ironically, people can only USE the app, if people use the app.
